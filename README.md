Just a small little Django project where I play around with using different rest API's with python.

I hope to have the following included by the time I'm finished:

  1. Basic details pages where you query different country information.
  2. A travel blog section, which will be linked to different country pages.
  3. Currency converted functionality via API calls (I'm looking at Fixer.io for this right now)
  4. Some sort of map if I can find a decent free API.
